Hereâ€™s a recommended .gitignore file for a Terraform project. This will help you avoid committing sensitive or unnecessary files such as state files, backup files, and provider-specific data.

gitignore
Copy code
# Local .terraform directories
**/.terraform/*

# Terraform state files
terraform.tfstate
terraform.tfstate.backup

# Crash log files
crash.log

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc

# Plan output files
*.tfplan

# Sensitive variable files
terraform.tfvars
#*.tfvars

# Lock file, which can vary between environments
.terraform.lock.hcl
